Open multi-platform game engine in JavaScript with Classes.

## About
Quick aims to provide a multi-platform, lightweight, easy-to-use engine to be used on game development, focusing in performance, quick development and maintainability. Based on the original engine used in Starship and Ms. Starship and using the techniques displayed on [JavaScript with Classes](https://diogoschneider.github.io/assets/JSwC.pdf), it has evolved with the continuous addition of new features.

Quick includes all requirements for a full-featured game included in a single library. It's the whole thing in a tiny package. It runs on any modern JavaScript runtime, from personal computers with gamepads and keyboards to personal digital assistants with touch screens. Write once, run everywhere... now for real.

## Advantages
  * Virtual resolution - run your game in any screen size without affecting your game logic;
  * Accessible - play with a common user interface for gamepad or keyboard;
  * Multiplatform - architecture agnostic at the core, all you need is a JavaScript runtime;
  * Complete - no further dependencies required;
  * Easy to use - rich, well defined API that feels natural to game development;
  * Agnostic - wheter you want to write your game with OOP or procedural code, the choice is yours;
  * Open - free to use, read, and extend it. Enjoy!
