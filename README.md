Open multi-platform game engine in JavaScript with classes.

## About
Quick aims to provide a multi-platform, lightweight, easy-to-use engine to be used on game development, focusing in performance, quick development and maintainability. Based on the original engine used in Starship and Ms. Starship and using the techniques displayed on [JavaScript with Classes](http://dgsprb.github.io/JavaScriptwithClasses.pdf), it has evolved with the continuous addition of new features.

Though mainly focused on building games to be released at the Chrome Web Store, it runs on any modern JavaScript runtime, from personal computers with gamepads and keyboards to personal digital assistants with touch screens. Write once, run everywhere... now for real.

Quick includes all requirements for a full-featured game included in a single library.
